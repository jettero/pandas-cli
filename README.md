# what is this?

I like the idea of using
[seaborn-command](https://github.com/kojix2/seaborn-command) but dislike the
input choices.

So then I thought, why can't I push my yaml or json or whatever though a pandas
commandline that can reformat things in a way seaborn-command wants to see them?

But then I also started to wonder if it made sense to allow the pandas-cli to
output various matplotlib and seaborn formats directly... maybe...

# focus

look, this project is essentially a brainstorm, so I'm not really sure what it
should do or not do...
